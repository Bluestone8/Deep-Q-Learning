## Evolution Timeline

### Phase 1: Basic CNN-DQN (R2.x series)

- Started with daily trading on 1-year data
- Evolved to hourly trading with 2-year data
- Added validation splits and evaluation metrics

### Phase 2: Regularization (R3.x series)

- Introduced dropout (0.3) to prevent overfitting
- Added transaction fees and random episode starts
- Increased replay buffer and adjusted hyperparameters

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (R3.2.1)

- Implemented Double DQN to reduce maximization bias
- Switched from MSE to Huber loss for stability
- Soft target network updates (Polyak averaging)
- Action space constraints for realistic trading

### Phase 4: Action Space Exploration (R4.x series)

- Expanded from 3 to 7 discrete actions
- Partial position scaling (10%, 25%, 50%)
- Long-term PnL bonus rewards

### Phase 5: Continuous Actions (R4.2)

- Implemented DDPG for continuous action space
- Actor-Critic architecture with target networks
- Drawdown risk penalties
- SAC comparison

### Phase 6: Architecture Exploration (Trade\_\*.ipynb series)

- Tested CNN, LSTM, and Transformer architectures
- Compared performance on synthetic data
- Transformer showed best results on synthetic GBM

## Key Technical Insights

1. **Regularization is Essential**: Dropout and weight decay critical for generalization
2. **Double DQN Works**: Significantly better than vanilla DQN
3. **Huber Loss Helps**: More stable than MSE for noisy financial data
4. **Real Data is Hard**: Models performed better on synthetic data
5. **CNN is Robust**: Best overall architecture for price pattern learning
6. **Transaction Costs Matter**: Must include fees for realistic performance
7. **Validation is Key**: Early stopping and monitoring essential

## Performance Highlights

**Best Model**: `02_cnn_dqn_with_dropout.ipynb`

- 34.52% return on validation
- Dropout + transaction fees + regularization
- 2-year training/validation split

**Most Advanced**: `03_cnn_dqn_improved.ipynb`

- Double DQN + Huber loss + soft updates
- Action constraints for realistic trading
- Comprehensive validation framework

**Continuous Actions**: `05_ddpg_sac_comparison.ipynb`
